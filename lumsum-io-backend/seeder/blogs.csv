Installing the perfect lighting fixtures can create a beautiful, functional space and boost productivity and comfort.</p>

<p>However, this task can be quite daunting as we need to find a balance between both, the utilitarian and aesthetic values. Additionally, we can get overwhelmed with the hundreds of available options while trying to look for the right style, quality and budget.</p>

<p>It becomes even more critical when choosing the lighting for our living room- the place where we will most likely be spending the majority of our time!</p>

<p>Whether you are looking to install lighting fixtures into your new living room or replacing your old ones, this post will provide you with some guidelines on how to make the best choices.</p>

<h3>1.&nbsp;Learn about the types</h3>

<p>One misconception that usually accompanies the lighting task is to assume that one lighting type is enough. Here are 3 main lighting types to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ambient lighting</strong>: It is the main source of light that fills the majority of the room and usually comes from recessed or overhead lighting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Accent Lighting</strong>: It provides a more aesthetically pleasing touch as it plays a role in highlighting a specific focal point, mainly a decorative element such as a piece of art.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Task lighting</strong>: As its name implies, it is used to support a specific activity such as night reading or desktop lighting.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.&nbsp;Explore the available categories</h3>

<p>Next, you will have to educate yourself on the different lighting categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Sconces</strong>: These are usually mounted on the wall. Wall sconces can be placed on each side of a mirror for example, while swing-arm scones are used as accent light .</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Flush Mounts</strong>: They are fixed in the ceiling and aim to brighten the room without occupying much space, making them ideal for smaller rooms or rooms with a low ceiling.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Pendants</strong>:&nbsp; They are rooted in the ceiling but they differ from mounts in that they hang low from the ceiling. They are usually used as task light and have one light bulb only.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Chandeliers</strong>:&nbsp; It is a large lighting system that suspends from the ceiling and gives different light sources at the same time. They are popular for their decorative use.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Lamps</strong>: They come in different styles and sizes and are often used as task lighting.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.&nbsp;Determine the size</h3>

<p>It is very important to keep your living room properly lit and choose lighting fixtures that are proportional in size.</p>

<p>While there are calculations that you can make to determine the size of your lighting, it can become a bit complicated. We recommend to go by the number of light bulbs in one fixture. So if your living room is relatively small, you can go with 3 light bulbs around 60 W in your ambient lighting, whereas if you have a relatively larger living room, you can go for 5 bulbs.</p>

<h3>4.&nbsp;Choose your Style</h3>

<p>It is highly recommended that the lighting complements the dominant element in your room such as the metal finishes, furniture or curtains so that it goes in line with your concept. However, if you have a very basic room design, you can choose a lighting style that adds a bold statement to your interior.</p>

<h3>Some additional&nbsp; tips</h3>

<p>After you have learned the basics on how to choose the lighting for your living room, it is important to remember that more light isn&rsquo;t necessarily better, and that you should focus on quality rather than quantity. It is about putting light where it is really needed and matching &nbsp;it with the performed task in a specific location.</p>

<p>Finally, do not forget about the natural light- alongside the artificial light- when designing your space!</p>

The quality of your household&rsquo;s water affects your health as well as your children&rsquo;s health. Children are the most affected by any contaminants that may be in the water. That is why it is very important to make sure that the water quality in your household is excellent. Choosing the right water filter is a key factor that affects water quality. Water filters have many features that you have to take into consideration. Not all filters have the same functions and in general, there is no filter that removes all kinds of polluting substances.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">In the following lines, we will guide you through few simple steps that would help you to choose the suitable water filter for your children&rsquo;s health</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Check the credibility of the manufacturer&nbsp;</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">You can check if the filter&rsquo;s manufacturer is certified by&nbsp;</span>The Public Health and Safety Organization (NSF)<span style=""color:#0e101a"">. The NSF is an independent organization that develops products health standards. The NSF has a public&nbsp;</span><span style=""color:#000000"">database</span><span style=""color:#0e101a"">&nbsp;with all the certified water treatment units&rsquo; manufacturers. You can search the database to make sure that your manufacturer is listed in it. You can search the database by manufacturer, product type, or brand name. You can also specify your country and your state.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size:22px"">Learn what exactly that you need to remove in water</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Water has two types of contaminants: bio-contaminants and chemical contaminants. Bio contaminants include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Chemical contaminants include salt, bleach, metals, and pesticides. The ideal way to discover the type of contaminants in your water is to make a sample analysis at a professional lab. However, there are simpler ways that could give you indicators about the type of contaminants your water has. If your water has a weird taste or smell, this suggests an organic contaminant like bacteria. If it has a rusty taste, this is probably an indicator for metals, minerals, or fouls. If it has a taste of chemicals this could be residues from pesticides or cleaners. Ideally, you would want a filter that protects your children against all contaminants. However, there is no kind of filter that would protect you against all contaminants.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Check what this filter protects you from&nbsp;</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Using the NSF database, you can check the contaminants that the filter reduces. This would assure you that the filter actually does what the manufacturer claims.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Activated carbon filter</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">This filter removes any organic residues that affect the taste and odor of the water. Some designs also remove bleach and cleaning solvents. However, it does not remove metals or bacteria.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Ion exchange unit</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Removes minerals that cause hard water like calcium and magnesium. However, if the water has oxidized iron, it will affect the filter&rsquo;s functionality and became slower. This type of filter also removes fluoride.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Reverse osmosis&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Removes foul taste and smell. Also removes sodium and petrochemicals. However, it does not remove organic contaminants. It also removes fluoride.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Desalination unit&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Removes nitrates, hardness, and heavy metals. The filter kills bacteria but it might grow back on the cooling coil when the filter is not working.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""color:#000000"">Be cautious!&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Ion exchange unit and reserve osmosis filters remove fluoride from water. This could be dangerous for kids. If the fluoride concentration in the water reaches less than 0.6 ppm, your children might need a fluoride supplement. In case of using one of those two filters, you should consult your children&rsquo;s doctor or dentist to recommend the proper supplement.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Using the previous steps and recommendations, you can now choose the right </span><a href=""https://www.lumsum.io/plumbing-water-material-suppliers/water-filter-suppliers"" style=""text-decoration:none""><span style=""color:#0563c1""><strong><u>water filter</u></strong></span></a><span style=""color:#0e101a""> that would protect your children&#39;s health and provide them with the best water quality.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Regardless of how you decorated your house, some items are essential to give it that homey feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is preferable to spend your money on items that are of good quality, complement your space, and can be easily fitted into most setups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Want to make sure you have everything you need in your house? Here are 5 pieces of furniture that every household must have. You can browse and check a great variety of furniture suppliers that can accommodate every taste.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Side tables&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If you do not have one of these in your house, you need to walk straight out of your door, and go buy one right away! Do not allow your sofa set to be alone in the room.&nbsp; Side tables are essential in your home, they can be fitted just about anywhere, they are one of the most versatile pieces of the house after all. Whether in the living room, bedroom, or dining area, a beautiful side table can help create a quiet ambiance full of elegance and grace. Side tables can come in every shape and form. Be sure to check many furniture suppliers until you find the piece that you need.</p>

<h3>2.&nbsp;Comfy Sofa Set</h3>

<p>The sofa is the centerpiece of any living room and the most used piece in your home. This is why investing in a great sofa is never a bad decision. So, go and get your dream sofa right away! There are so many furniture suppliers that can help you. Be careful to choose a sofa that accommodates your needs: Big rooms require a sofa that can steal the show, but a small comfy bed couch can have a big impact on rooms with a tighter space. But the golden rule is to always choose resilient and long-lasting materials that can withstand anything you throw into it.</p>

<h3>3.&nbsp;Dining Table&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Even if you eat on the couch or in your room, a dining table is always a must. We suggest using round tables for a central space in a smaller area, while long rectangular tables are better for dedicated dining rooms. Make sure that the chairs are comfortable enough to sit on for a long time and bring on a couple of extra ones to accommodate house guests. But no matter what shape or size of a table you think you need; our broad list of furniture suppliers will always have an example to fit your taste.</p>

<h3>4.&nbsp;Comfortable Bed&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This goes without saying. The bed is one of the first furniture pieces you buy in any home. But a good-looking bed must always be accompanied by a comfy mattress. After all, investing in a good mattress is directly linked with having a nice and sound sleep. So, for the sake of your health and well-being, go and get that bed and mattress that you always felt the need to have. But make sure to complement your mattress with a couple of nice pillows and high-quality cotton sheets. If you are living in the UAE, you can find several furniture suppliers that have a comprehensive list of all your bedroom furniture needs.</p>

<h3>5.&nbsp;Mirror&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Mirrors, mirrors, mirrors this might sound obvious, but you always must have good mirrors around the house. How many times have you wanted to check yourself right before going out and the only mirror you found was the small foggy one you have in the bathroom? A mirror is an underrated piece of furniture that you can easily forget about, but you always know its actual worth whenever you need one but cannot find it. So just go and buy a mirror and install it behind one of your closet doors, in your home entrance, or even between the bedrooms; there is (almost) a wrong place to put a mirror in.&nbsp;</p>

You should pay attention to many things such as color techniques, furniture arranging, mirror placement, and creative lighting design to create elevated, airy spaces. Here are some tips and tricks to make a small space look bigger. You can also browse and check a great variety of furniture suppliers that can give you innovative ideas and help you a lot.</p>

<h3>Cut the clutter</h3>

<p>The first step you should make is to try and make your space organized. Loads of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; can easily make your room look smaller.&nbsp; You should always think hard about the purpose of everything in that room. If it is rarely used and doesn&rsquo;t bring you joy, don&rsquo;t even think of buying it from the beginning. Put in mind that negative space always allows the eye to travel someplace else and rest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware of never covering your walls with a lot of pictures. When you are thinking about how to make a room look bigger, you should pay attention that hanging one large painting works better than a group of small paintings on the wall.</p>

<h3>Go big</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, it is better to choose one big piece of furniture instead of having multiple smaller ones. For example, a bigger sofa placed right next to the wall works better than having multiple chairs spread across space. But be careful not to choose &ldquo;heavy furniture&rdquo;: you can always find big pieces that also look light and have a more see-through appeal. You can skim through our list of furniture suppliers to search for a piece that suits&nbsp;you the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Multi-functional furniture</h3>

<p>Multi-functional furniture can also help you, such as a chest that can be used as a coffee table, a sofa that can be turned into a bed, or a bed that has storage drawers underneath. Expandable dining tables, folding tables, and nesting tables, which can be tucked away when you don&rsquo;t need them, are also a good pick.</p>

<h3>Different kinds of wall</h3>

<p>Who said that the wall must be standing without any function? If you are willing to put some effort, you can use some of your walls and turn them into built-in closets. This way the closet would look more flushed and had a better impact on the overall feel of the room. You can also convert walls into resets built-in bookcases, this way, you would not worry about the square space a free-standing bookcase would take. Plus, having the shelves resets would mean less worrying about dust buildup. So, if you are living in the UAE, you can find several furniture suppliers that have a comprehensive list of all your needs.</p>

<h3>Let there be light</h3>

<p>Any room will look larger if it&#39;s well-lighted. You can also add more lamps or install track lighting or recessed lighting in case you don&rsquo;t have wide windows or if your windows do not allow enough light to come in.&nbsp; Get rid of heavy draperies and use lighter ones to open up the windows and bring the light of the outdoors into the room.&nbsp; But this is not the only thing to worry about: the size of your draperies matters as well. Their wits should be the same as the window, but their heights should not be as such. They should start from the ceiling and go all the way down to the floor. This would create a more elongated view that would help the room seem taller. Another way to manipulate light is by installing mirrors in strategic places.</p>

<p>Mirrors can also make your room look bigger. Can you believe it? Always think about adding reflective surfaces to your room. Mirrors can enhance the effect of natural light in creating the illusion of a bigger space. Be sure to check many furniture suppliers until you find the mirror that you need.</p>

<h3>Create a focal point<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Learn how to make a room look bigger by establishing a focal point. In the dining room, for example, that&rsquo;s probably the table. In the bedroom, it&rsquo;s the bed. So, what you should do is to arrange the furniture so that the focus is drawn to that area. This is where big furniture can help you emphasize even more on this focal point.</p>

<h3>Use vibrant paint&nbsp;</h3>

<p>You might think that white would make a room larger, but it is not the case whereas deeper colors do so by making corners disappear. If you want to use a light color, use two shades on the wall: keep a darker shade on the lower part to fuse the walls into each other which would make them look larger. Then, use a lighter shade on the upper part of the wall to create an optical illusion that it will raise the ceiling and make the room seem bigger. If you have carpeting on the floor, paint the baseboards the same color to further stretch the floor area. So, if you are living in the UAE, you can find several paint suppliers that have a comprehensive list of all your needs concerning the color of the wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overwhelmed yet? No need to worry. If you are living in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, or any other emirate in the UAE, you can always find the most reliable &amp; latest information about interior design on Lumsum.io.</p>

<p>The best option is to find the right supplier. Instead of getting your water heaters, hydronic pumps, or any plumbing material supply from a random supplier.&nbsp;Now, let us discuss everything about sanitary ware.</p>

<h3>What are the different plumbing pipes offered by plumbing material suppliers?</h3>

<p>Out of all the sanitary products the most important are perhaps plumbing pipes. It is beneficial to know which type of piping system needs installation for various tasks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the commonly used pipes for plumbing systems. We have also listed their uses along with a brief on each type.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Ductile Iron Pipes</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These&nbsp;types of plumbing pipes distribute filtered water. They are of ductile iron. This makes them a slightly enhanced version of generic iron pipes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Galvanized Iron Pipes:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Galvanized Iron or GI pipes help in the transmission of water in a building. Steel pipes have a coating of zinc, manufactured in three categories. These are heavy grade, medium grade, and light grade based on their thickness.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Concrete Pipes:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Concrete pipes are a mixture of water, gravel, cement, and sand. They are the most durable building material available. Also, they come in two varieties&mdash;pre-stressed, reinforced, and unreinforced.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>PVC Pipes:&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Polyvinyl Chloride pipes are typically light in weight and used to carry water. They are non-corrosive and won&rsquo;t cost you a lot. They don&rsquo;t require any threading making them one of the best plumbing options on the market.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Stone Ware Pipes:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Stone Ware (SW) pipes are clay-made and used in drainage or sewage systems. They can transfer corrosive chemicals and be used for irrigation. SW pipes are laid on regular surfaces underground and are quite stiff.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Asbestos Cement Pipes:&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Asbestos cement pipes or AC pipes are the traditional way to remove water or soil from roofs. They also purify the air in buildings. There are two types of AC pipes available&mdash;with beading (WB) and without beading (WOB). Plumbers in Dubai, UAE, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and many other places recommend the WOB AC pipes if needed. However, these are now replaced with much lighter and cheaper PVC pipes.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Cast Iron Pipes: </strong>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cast iron (CI) pipes are normally used as pressure pipes. They can transmit water, sewage, and gas in a convenient and budget-friendly way. CI pipes are resistant to rust and corrosion. This makes them perfect to use as transmission pipes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Steel Pipes: </strong>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Steel pipes are a stronger alternative to CI pipes. Their only downside is they aren&rsquo;t resistant to rust and corrosion. You must take additional measures to save them from adverse atmospheric conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Copper Pipes:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Copper pipes have high tensile strength. These help to operate electric water heaters. For people wanting a sauna and jacuzzi, copper pipes are the best way to go.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What is the best piping material to get from the suppliers?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>As mentioned, different types of pipes are for different purposes. Where a CI pipe is ideal to use as a pressure pipe, for transmission of clean water, you should get a ductile pipe.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How much do the suppliers charge?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Plumbing material suppliers can charge anywhere between $3,000 to $12,000 based on the size of the project. They can charge you per linear foot as well, so make sure to get a quote before finalizing a supplier.&nbsp;Several other factors increase the cost of plumbing material. Do you want to replace the entire drainage system, or are you looking for minor changes?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The complexity of the piping also determines the cost of plumbing. If you need booster pumps, you will need to pay additional charges. A good water booster pump costs around $<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=water+booster+pump+cost+in+UAE&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enIN932IN932&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02vSKcMGanbxcE9hbTlAk4MvD98tA%3A1623087371882&amp;ei=C1m-YKqyNZKfmgfEhaGwBw&amp;oq=water+booster+pump+cost+in+UAE&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEM0CMgUIABDNAjIFCAAQzQIyBQgAEM0COgcIABBHELADOgQIIxAnOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeUN0XWLYrYKsuaAFwAngAgAGwA4gBxQiSAQkwLjMuMS4wLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq4_XRh4bxAhWSj-YKHcRCCHYQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5"">800</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Once you hit enter, you will see the best plumbing suppliers near you.&nbsp;However, make sure you pick a supplier with good ratings from its customers.

<p><strong><span dir=""LTR"">1.&nbsp;Safety</span></strong></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">Safety comes on the top of our list. </span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">While fixing a leaky toilet or a squeaky door may not pose any threat on you, other jobs can be seriously dangerous, and can actually kill you! So ask yourself first: Are there any red flags? Does the electrical work involved require a supplier? The answers will provide a warning sign in case the job requires hiring a professional.</span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">Another aspect to look at is whether this job requires a permit to be performed, as this can also be an indicator that it should be undergone by a certified professional who will possess an understanding of the local safety rules and regulations and comply to them.</span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">In addition, one shall examine the potential long-term effects of a poorly performed DIY task. While a failed electric work can cause a direct harm, other indirect threats can remain unnoticed for years and can result in a serious destruction when you least expect it.</span></p>

<p><strong><span dir=""LTR"">2.&nbsp;Time &amp; Money</span></strong></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">These 2 interrelated factors will help you determine whether you should roll up your sleeves or ask for professional help. Obviously, people will think that DIY is cheaper than hiring an experienced supplier. However, this is not true in all cases, as you will have to take into consideration the price of tools and material needed that suppliers possess, and more importantly, the potential damage that a DIY might cause and the subsequent cost of re-fixing in case anything goes wrong. Yes, mistakes can be costly! Add to this the amount of time required to perform the job and whether you can be investing it in something more valuable.</span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">The best way to approach this is to make an assessment of the total cost and time. Start by determining the price of outsourcing the service. Second, figure out the cost of doing it yourself through calculating the price of needed tools and materials that suppliers use and researching the time needed to perform the job yourself. Then do the math! Calculate your hourly wage, compare it to that of the supplier and ask yourself: Is it worth it?</span></p>

<p><strong><span dir=""LTR"">3. Skills and Quality of Work</span></strong></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">Quality is something you do not want to compromise on. Whenever you want to DIY, ask yourself, how well can you learn to perform this task? Are you willing to watch step-by-step tutorials and read instruction manuals thoroughly? How patient are you with small details and how much are you willing to re-work if you didn&rsquo;t nail the perfect results from the first attempt?</span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">While some may view home improvement as a hobby rather than a duty, many others might not be flexible enough to work through small mistakes and would prefer to lift the burden off their shoulders by hiring an experienced </span><span dir=""LTR"">supplier. </span></p>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">Moreover, what are your desired results? Are you fine with just &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; or do you seek a perfect outcome? Doing it yourself might not end up to be as well or as neat as that of a pro&rsquo;s work. Uneven paint or floor </span><span dir=""LTR"">ceramic tiles are not uncommon with DIY. If you really do not mind and can live with minor errors, then it might be worthy to try it. However, if you are looking for example to sell your house, then you probably want it to be in the best condition.</span></p>

<h3><span dir=""LTR"">When to DIY and when to leave it for the pros</span></h3>

<p><span dir=""LTR"">Many home improvement tasks can be easily performed by the homeowner without a serious risk or notable compromise on quality and will thus be a great way to save money. These can include painting house interiors or bathroom cabinets, installing vinyl flooring, or maybe a simple and straightforward window trimming that you learned to perform over the internet. In fact, DIY can be an enjoyable process for those who love to learn and experiment. However, some other tasks may not fall within the skills of the regular homeowner and are best performed by a professional especially when it comes to <a href=""https://www.lumsum.io/electrical-suppliers""><ins>electrical</ins></a> and <a href=""https://www.lumsum.io/plumbing-water-material-suppliers""><ins>plumbing</ins></a> works, many </span><span dir=""LTR"">suppliers</span><span dir=""LTR""> can do the job. </span></p>

d5c3a809-3223-4e8b-a6af-824350ba27e6,tips-on-choosing-the-right-color-from-paint-suppliers,Tips on Choosing the Right Color from Paint Suppliers,"<p>Whether you are painting your house for the first time or wanting to re-paint it, lucky for you, you are in the right place. Creating a successful combination of colors can be easily done by following some simple steps.</p>

<p>Picking the right paint for your home can be a tricky and difficult task where you can spend hours or even days deciding yet still end up making the wrong choices. Well, you are not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines that can help you before and during choosing the right paint for your whole house.</p>

<h3>What affects the color choice</h3>

<p><strong>a. Lighting</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the amount and angle of the sun change, so will your room colors!&nbsp; Light plays a huge role in color perception. In lower light, the color appears darker and less intense. As you increase the amount of light, the color will appear lighter and more intense.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the color that you choose at the store can look different in the room you want to paint since the lighting is never the same between your house and the paint suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best color temperature for indoor lighting is 2200-2700K. It produces a warm light that is best for low-light areas where ambient lighting is needed similar to an incandescent bulb. 3000-3500K produces a soft white light that&#39;s crisper than 2700K, similar to halogen lamps.</p>

<p><strong>b. Floor&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Pay attention that due to your flooring choice, your room can be seen as bigger, smaller, warmer, or cooler. Keep in mind that the floor color should always be darker than the walls. This rule generally applies because lighter walls and a dark floor make the room seem larger. There are two ways to coordinate your walls with your floors&#39; undertones: make them match or make them complementary. You can choose wall paints that match the warmth of your undertones in your flooring. So, if you are living in the UAE, you can find several paint suppliers that have a comprehensive list of all your needs concerning the color of the floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>c. Furniture&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Check the dominant color of your furniture and choose the contrasting color for it. Or you can choose a color from the same family as the dominant furniture color. This way, the furniture color is nicely tied to the color of the walls without being too obvious.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that any light color might reflect the colors that surround it. A white wall, for example, will take on the reflections from carpeting, ceiling color, and even furniture. You can browse and check a great variety of paint suppliers that can accommodate every taste.</p>

<p><strong>d. Size of the room&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Wall colors influence room size also! Can you believe it? Choosing lighter colors bright a room and make it feel larger. Darker colors give larger rooms a smaller and much more cozy feel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can even have two tones for your walls, a darker bottom part, and the lighter top part can give the effect of a higher selling which would make the room bigger than it is. Alternatively, to make the room looks bigger you can add mirrors to your walls, or you can use vertical wooden strips to add some verticality to your walls. Be sure to check many paint suppliers until you find the color that you need.</p>

<h3>Choosing your colors</h3>

<p><strong>a. Find inspiration for your color scheme.</strong></p>

<p>Do some research to find the right color combination that suits you. You can borrow inspiration from interior design websites, catalogs, and magazines, or even the environment outside your house. And this brings us to two important points: it is always a good choice to bring the environment that surrounds your house inside, was it through the paint color or plants that complemented. Second, do not always assume that if a paint scheme does not work for someone, then it will not work for you. You should always try and see for yourself what works and what does not for your home.</p>

<p><strong>b. Use a Color wheel or color swatches</strong></p>

<p>A color wheel is a tool used to show the relationship between colors. The three traditional sets of complementary colors, as derived from the Red-Yellow-Blue color model, are red/ green, yellow/purple, and orange/ blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colors have an emotional effect also! Warm colors such as red, yellow, and orange convey emotions ranging from comfort and warmth to hostility and anger. Cool colors such as green, blue, and purple often spark feelings of calmness.</p>

<p><strong>c. Be sure to test samples&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Once you narrow down your paint color choices, return to the store for some samples to try at home. This step is crucial to find the perfect color. So, always take the time to test some samples and see how the colors appear in the room. Try to test multiple samples on your walls next to permanent fixtures in your home to see which one fits best.</p>

However, many people do not go regularly for different reasons. Some people claim that they do not have the time to exercise, others claim that they can&rsquo;t make it to the gym and many fitness enthusiasts hesitate to join because of the fear of Covid-19 and not wanting to interact with people. So how about bringing the gym to you?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your own house can still be the ideal place to train. The home gym is a great addition whether it is the primary place to work out or not. Home gyms have many advantages: you don&rsquo;t need a car to get to the gym, you can potentially save money, you can take your time working out, there are no distractions, no germs and it is open 24/7.</p>

<h3>What are the home gym essentials?</h3>

<p>A home gym is a big investment with a big return, it is worth every penny. Before building a home gym there are a few things that should be considered:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The budget</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Space limitations&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Weight capacity&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Safety requirements</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The home gym you will build depends on your financial capabilities, the space available, and what kind of workout you want to do. Some people only want to do calisthenic workouts such as jogging, push-ups, and jumping jacks. Others want to do bulk-up workouts and heavy lifting. The amount of space needed to train can be small if you are looking to do simple cardio and calisthenic exercises. Concerning the cost, it is possible to build a high-quality home gym for less than 1000 $. It can cost a lot more if you plan on getting all the equipment which is not necessary especially if you are new at this. Whatever it is that you plan on doing, Lumsum will help you find the best gym equipment suppliers available.</p>

<h3>The home gym essentials are:&nbsp;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>A Jump Rope:</strong> Jump ropes are very affordable and portable. Jumping rope is a killer cardio workout; it builds agility and quickness and improves your coordination.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Dumbbells: </strong>Working with dumbbells helps you gain muscles. Even if your goal is not to build muscles, dumbbells can be used for calisthenic workouts; they are important for building strength and burning calories.&nbsp;Concerning the weights and number of dumbbells needed this varies between a person and another but there are adjustable dumbbells and they help reduce the number of dumbbells and can be budget-friendly and help save space.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Pull-Up Bar: </strong>A pull-up bar can be easily attached to a door frame and it doesn&rsquo;t take any space. Pull-ups strengthen the upper body.&nbsp;</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Barbell: </strong>A barbell is a critical tool. It does not replace dumbbells though. Barbells are better for heavy lifting.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>

	<p><strong>Weight Plates: </strong>Used with barbells and dumbbells to produce a bar with a specific certain weight.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>

</ul>
